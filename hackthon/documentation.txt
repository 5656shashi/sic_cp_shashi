(1)
> The csv file Banglore_traffic.csv is taken from Kaggle website
> The obtained csv file had many duplicates values and repeated area names 
> By using excle I removed all duplicates and got a data set with unique area names
> The csv file is attached in hackthon folder along with the code

(2)
>The code has been written to generate 3 graphs 
>First graph shows the 5 places in bangalore where traffic volume is very high
    >Bar graph is the best way to visualize the individual data
> Second graph shows the variation in Congestion with increas in traffic volume
    > Line graph is suitable to show variation of one patrameter with respect to change in other
    > We can conclude that the congestion increases with increase in traffic volume from the graph
> Third graph shows the amount of public transport based on Pedestrian and cycle users
    > Line graph is suitable to show variation of one patrameter with respect to change in other
    > We can conclude that more the Pedestrians more is the public transport which helps us reduce the useage of cars and bikes foe individual travel
